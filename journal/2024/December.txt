1st day of the last month of 2024! Let's end things with a bang.

Monday December 2

23:34

One of my previous job applications became active again. It's been almost 6 months since they closed it, but maybe things will work out this time around? I can only hope.

A big thing I learned today is that people put in so much effort trading just to underperform compared to the S&P500. The wisest idea is to actually just throw all your money into an ETF. Even if you miss out on some big individual jumps you'll still perform great without having to think or get emotionally invested.

Wednesday December 4

23:44

First day back applying for jobs once again!

Thursday December 5

23:39

Can't think of anything to type aha.

Friday December 6

23:44

It's nice to be appreciated by others when you least expect it.

Saturday December 7

22:55

Kinda feeling the burnout of reading web novels since a lot of the time they end up super rushed. I'll slow down my pace of reading them and also be more selective. Currently reading Reverend Insanity.

Sunday December 8

23:23

Started watching anime again for the first time in a month.

Monday December 9

23:14

Work only ever feels productive when there's visible progress.

Tuesday December 10

23:26

I feel like every night I tell myself that tomorrow is the day where I'm going to be a 10x worker, but it's never happened yet ahaha.

Wednesday December 11

23:25

Sucks how a person can spend years playing a sport and still suck a lot at it.

Thursday December 12

23:41

I decided to reread some chapters of The Greatest Estate Developer, and man it really is such a good manhwa. Every single chapter makes you laugh and it's touching in all the right places.

Friday December 13

23:50

It's such an addicting feeling getting to the point in a story where the plot picks up and suddenly you can't stop reading.

Sunday December 15

23:24

I can't believe I forgot to write an entry yesterday, even though I could've sworn I did.

Something I wonder nowadays is what dinners are like outside of my family. Do people usually talk? Or do they keep silent? Personally I just eat and go, but some members in my family like to talk.

Monday December 16 23:24

Worked on an assessment for a company that pays you per task to train their AI. Hopefully I'll get this since the partime pay looks to be lucrative.

Tuesday December 17 23:36

It's much better to take your time on a task then rush through it and realize you misunderstood the requirements from the bottom up.

Wednesday December 18 23:35

Coming up with a design idea for a creative piece is very frustrating. There's always something that you feel is a bit awkward.

Thursday December 19 23:29

Maybe I should consider learning data analysis, since I enjoy feeling smart.

Friday December 20 23:06

My application that was put on hold in July has finally resumed 5 months later. Finally!

Saturday December 21 23:38

Your days feel a lot better when you can talk about what you did without hesitation. For example saying "I played games the entire day" feels a lot worse compared to "I played games for 2 hours" because in the latter you spent the rest of your day doing something else. Not saying that playing games is a bad thing of course.

Sunday December 22 23:29

As you get older you really do start getting random pains in your body.

Monday December 23 23:39

Ah terrible news regarding the application; I have to start the entire process from the beginning and who knows how long that's going to take.

Tuesday December 24 23:46

Merry Christmas Eve! I'm really excited for the new FGO chapter dropping tomorrow.

Wednesday December 25 23:31

Completed all the released sections for part 1 and am now waiting for part 2 and 3. Once again FGO does not disappoint in its storytelling. 

Had a fun Christmas day.

Thursday December 26 23:25

Today was one of those tiring days. Not a good feeling I must say.
