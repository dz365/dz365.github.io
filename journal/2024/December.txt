1st day of the last month of 2024! Let's end things with a bang.

23:34

One of my previous job applications became active again. It's been almost 6 months since they closed it, but maybe things will work out this time around? I can only hope.

A big thing I learned today is that people put in so much effort trading just to underperform compared to the S&P500. The wisest idea is to actually just throw all your money into an ETF. Even if you miss out on some big individual jumps you'll still perform great without having to think or get emotionally invested.

First day back applying for jobs once again!

Can't think of anything to type aha.

Friday December 6

23:44

It's nice to be appreciated by others when you least expect it.

Saturday December 7

22:55

Kinda feeling the burnout of reading web novels since a lot of the time they end up super rushed. I'll slow down my pace of reading them and also be more selective. Currently reading Reverend Insanity.

Sunday December 8

23:23

Started watching anime again for the first time in a month.

Work only ever feels productive when there's visible progress.

23:26

I feel like every night I tell myself that tomorrow is the day where I'm going to be a 10x worker, but it's never happened yet ahaha.

Sucks how a person can spend years playing a sport and still suck a lot at it.

Thursday December 12

23:41

I decided to reread some chapters of The Greatest Estate Developer, and man it really is such a good manhwa. Every single chapter makes you laugh and it's touching in all the right places.

23:50

It's such an addicting feeling getting to the point in a story where the plot picks up and suddenly you can't stop reading.

Sunday December 15

23:24

I can't believe I forgot to write an entry yesterday, even though I could've sworn I did.

Something I wonder nowadays is what dinners are like outside of my family. Do people usually talk? Or do they keep silent? Personally I just eat and go, but some members in my family like to talk.

Monday December 16 23:24

Worked on an assessment for a company that pays you per task to train their AI. Hopefully I'll get this since the partime pay looks to be lucrative.

Tuesday December 17 23:36

It's much better to take your time on a task then rush through it and realize you misunderstood the requirements from the bottom up.

Wednesday December 18 23:35

Coming up with a design idea for a creative piece is very frustrating. There's always something that you feel is a bit awkward.

Thursday December 19 23:29

Maybe I should consider learning data analysis, since I enjoy feeling smart.
