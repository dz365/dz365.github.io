A big thing I learned today is that people put in so much effort trading just to underperform compared to the S&P500. The wisest idea is to actually just throw all your money into an ETF. Even if you miss out on some big individual jumps you'll still perform great without having to think or get emotionally invested.

Kinda feeling the burnout of reading web novels since a lot of the time they end up super rushed. I'll slow down my pace of reading them and also be more selective. Currently reading Reverend Insanity.
