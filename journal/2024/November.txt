After reading so many chapters of eastern web novels, I've gained an appreciation for cooking. Eating is something that we all do and spend a lot of time doing, so why not make every meal is a good one? If you're having a bad day, then it'll be something to look forward to, and if you're having a good day, then it can only get better from here on out.

It's funny how people never look at you the same way you look at yourself. You think you're doing a terrible job, but everyone else is super happy. Of course this applies both ways...
