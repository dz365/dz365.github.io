After reading so many chapters of eastern web novels, I've gained an appreciation for cooking. Eating is something that we all do and spend a lot of time doing, so why not make every meal is a good one? If you're having a bad day, then it'll be something to look forward to, and if you're having a good day, then it can only get better from here on out.

Anything is a poison if given a high enough dosage. Especially hobbies and things you enjoy doing. If you don't pace yourself well, eventually your feelings will turn.

My dad finally became a citizen today! Going to America without worry has been on his bucket list for a while and I'm happy he'll finally get the chance to go there.

It's funny how people never look at you the same way you look at yourself. You think you're doing a terrible job, but everyone else is super happy. Of course this applies both ways...

Working out and taking good care of your body feels really good the few hours after you're done.

When you binge something in one sitting, I feel like you don't enjoy it as much compared to enjoying it over a period of time.

If you're ever bored with your daily life, just try doing something different each day. For example, decide to eat 2 meals instead of 3 this Monday. You'll be surprised how different your day will end up from that.

It's actually pretty fun when you plan an approach to a problem and then see it be perfectly executed. Beats throwing whatever you have at it and saves a lot more time and mental capacity.

A lot of things you do in life is a constant up and down cycle. If you're having a bad moment, good times will eventually come if you're patient and slowly claw your way back up.

Wednesday November 13

In most scenarios you'll encounter, small but persistent efforts will get you much farther than sporadic large ones.

When put to the test, we are a lot more capable than we think. So don't let your confidence and low self esteem stop you from doing your thing.

I think life would be a lot more fun if work was only a way to pass time, instead of taking up the majority of our lives.

Spending a bit of time seeing what you need to do the next day pays off.

Thursday November 21

When stuck on a problem, take a break. Many breaks later, if you still can't solve it, then switch up your approach.

Friday November 22

It's honestly really hard designing a good looking interface. Everytime you think something is perfect, a few hour later you see a ton of flaws with your design and want to restart everything all over again.

Saturday November 23

23:30

Everyone has trigger words or phrases that can set them off, so when you know you'll be spending time with them for awhile, make sure to avoid saying them if you wish to avoid arguments and the atmosphere randomly getting tense.

If I were to cut down social media from my life I'd probably have an extra hour or two in my life everyday. Which sums up to a lot over the span of a lifetime.

Some days you feel like you get nothing done, when in fact you've actually accomplished a whole lot.
