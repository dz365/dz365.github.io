I started on a data analysis project today involving TTC bus traffic delay. It's enjoyable, though the concern I have is that my analysis is surface level, i.e. is plotting points on a graph and writing what you see not too simple?

One of my major flaws is that I want to be able to do something in moments, be it picking up a new skill or starting a new project. But when it takes longer than expected, I want to do something else. It's not realistic to be good at something without putting in the effort, yet I'm just so impatient.

Got my first non negative response today! It's from a startup and even though there's a high chance I won't pass the initial phone interview, I've finally made some sort of progress over the last couple of months.

Well today's interview went poorly aha. When I was asked the question where I see myself in 5 years and what I'm best in the world at, my brain just froze. A year ago I would've been able to answer this just fine but now I'm not sure. What do I want to be doing in 5 years? 

Somehow I still advanced to the next stage with a take home assessment due in a few days. I plan to finish it, but I'm not too optimistic about my future chances.

Worked on the take home assessment. Not much to say about it other than the fact that I really need to take my time reading the instructions and planning before writing. So much time would have been saved.

Also went out to eat at a Korean restaurant with a couple of friends. Had a blast playing the jester.

Did a bit more work on the take home. Every major feature is complete, just some minor bugs and styling adjusments to make.

Submitted the assessment today. Regardless of the results, I'm happy with the amount of effort I put into it and learned a lot of valuable things.

Started reading Losing Money to Be a Tycoon. Another really funny misunderstanding WN.

Wrote a script to help make my LinkedIn job search a bit easier. Started using a new job search site called hiring.cafe. Seems promising.
