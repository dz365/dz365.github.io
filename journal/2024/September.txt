I pretty much did nothing today ahaha.

Monday September 2

22:24

I started on a data analysis project today involving TTC bus traffic delay. It's enjoyable, though the concern I have is that my analysis is surface level, i.e. is plotting points on a graph and writing what you see not too simple?

One of my major flaws is that I want to be able to do something in moments, be it picking up a new skill or starting a new project. But when it takes longer than expected, I want to do something else. It's not realistic to be good at something without putting in the effort, yet I'm just so impatient.

Got my first non negative response today! It's from a startup and even though there's a high chance I won't pass the initial phone interview, I've finally made some sort of progress over the last couple of months.

Wednesday September 4

Well today's interview went poorly aha. When I was asked the question where I see myself in 5 years and what I'm best in the world at, my brain just froze. A year ago I would've been able to answer this just fine but now I'm not sure. What do I want to be doing in 5 years? 

Somehow I still advanced to the next stage with a take home assessment due in a few days. I plan to finish it, but I'm not too optimistic about my future chances.

Thursday September 5

23:05

Worked on the take home assessment. Not much to say about it other than the fact that I really need to take my time reading the instructions and planning before writing. So much time would have been saved.

Also went out to eat at a Korean restaurant with a couple of friends. Had a blast playing the jester.

23:15

Did a bit more work on the take home. Every major feature is complete, just some minor bugs and styling adjusments to make. 

Saturday September 7

23:26

Submitted the assessment today. Regardless of the results, I'm happy with the amount of effort I put into it and learned a lot of valuable things.

Started reading Losing Money to Be a Tycoon. Another really funny misunderstanding WN.

Sunday September 8

23:23

Spend the whole day reading more Losing Money to Be a Tycoon.

Monday September 9

23:36

Nothing too notable.

Tuesday September 10

23:30

Had to run some errands at the bank today.

Wednesday September 11

23:29

Wrote a script to help make my LinkedIn job search a bit easier. Started using a new job search site called hiring.cafe. Seems promising.

Thursday September 12

23:19

Improve my LinkedIn job search script. Generated some frontend project ideas. Still trying to figure out what I want to do, but it's hard being selective in this job market.

Friday September 13

23:48

Starting to get a bit more positive feedback on my applications. Could this be the turning point? 

Almost done recovering from a neck strain.

Saturday September 14

23:20

Looks like hiring is definitely picking up. Next week is an important one for me as I have an interview scheduled sometime then. I have limited options at this point so I really need to pick up the slack for the remainder of the month.

Sunday September 15

23:39

Other than practicing some interview questions I really didn't do all that much today. 

Monday September 16

14:38

Once again, the interview went really poorly. From the begininning I was rambling and struggling to communicate my thoughts. On the bright side, I understand what I need to do moving forwards. I need to be familiar with everything in my resume and be prepared to discuss each point thoroughly. I also need a lot more practice answering interview question more consisely.

It feels really awful missing out on the few chances I have, given how little there are in the first place.

Tuesday September 17

23:39

Somehow, I made it to the next round of interviews. Looks like this particular scene isn't over yet. I don't know what to expect, but I'm going to do what I can in the next two days.

The Dangers in My Heart is a good watch for those who don't mind romcom animes. Lots of good moments in the 2nd season.

Wednesday September 18

23:39

Looked at some frontend interview preparation platforms and also checked out some interesting projects.

Thursday September 19

23:34

Did my best reviewing React knowledge in preperation for tomorrow. I realized that there's a lot of things I still don't know. I guess whatever happens, happens.

Friday September 20

14:40

Well, the interview definitely could have gone better. Every resource was available but I jumped into coding too quickly without spending enough time planning an approach. I also tackled bonus features, which ultimately led to me not completing key functionalities. In aiming for both targets, I hit none. 

I learned a lot from this and I know that next time, things will go different.

Saturday September 21

23:22

When you know you need to improve your resume by working on new projects but you can't think of anything fun to do...

Sunday September 22

23:32

Two candles flicker in the duskâ€™s soft glow, one warms my heart, the other lets me go. Fun or usefulness, which one is the correct choice?

Monday September 23

23:37

Somehow, I reached the final round of interviews. I'm really grateful for everything that's happened so far, and no matter what happens tomorrow, I can look back on this last week with a wistful smile.

Tuesday September 24

23:41

It's all over now, mostly for the good. I gave my best efforts during the interview and I'm satisfied how I performed given the conditions. Of course, there's a world where I could've done better, but I'll know the results tomorrow.

Wednesday September 25

23:42

Rest day.

Thursday September 26

20:20

It looks like I did not get the job. Ah. Even though I knew I wasn't the best candidate, why does it still hurt?

Friday September 27

23:31

One of my job applications made it to the round of interviews. Let's hope that I'll do better answering behavioural questions this time around.
