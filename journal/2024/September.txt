I started on a data analysis project today involving TTC bus traffic delay. It's enjoyable, though the concern I have is that my analysis is surface level, i.e. is plotting points on a graph and writing what you see not too simple?

One of my major flaws is that I want to be able to do something in moments, be it picking up a new skill or starting a new project. But when it takes longer than expected, I want to do something else. It's not realistic to be good at something without putting in the effort, yet I'm just so impatient.
