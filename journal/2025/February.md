1st month of 2025 has already ended and now the second one begins! My goal for this month is to make some more money, and read some interesting things.

### Sunday 2, 23:29

Couldn't find it in me to work my paid job this weekend. But I think I'll be good to go starting tomorrow.

### Tuesday 4, 22:58

I watched the hour long prelude for the new Fate series (Fate/strange Fake) and I'm really hyped.

### Thursday 6, 23:26

Nothing notable to record over the last few days.

### Saturday 8, 23:38

There's definitely been a lot more snowfall this winter compared to last.

### Wednesday 12, 23:07

Major snowfall tonight and tomorrow. This winter has been one of the best ones that I can remember in the past many years.

I started consistently applying to jobs again, but this time with a more targeted approach. I'm strictly focused on applying for more frontend focused roles since I don't like dealing with cloud services and setup all that much. It's not like I'll actually get any interviews with my current application so might as well apply to things I'll enjoy.

Doing something mobile related also seems interesting, but I don't have any app ideas at the moment.
