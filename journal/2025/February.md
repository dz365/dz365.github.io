1st month of 2025 has already ended and now the second one begins! My goal for this month is to make some more money, and read some interesting things.

Couldn't find it in me to work my paid job this weekend. But I think I'll be good to go starting tomorrow.

### Tuesday 4, 22:58

I watched the hour long prelude for the new Fate series (Fate/strange Fake) and I'm really hyped.

Nothing notable to record over the last few days.

There's definitely been a lot more snowfall this winter compared to last.

Major snowfall tonight and tomorrow. This winter has been one of the best ones that I can remember in the past many years.

I started consistently applying to jobs again, but this time with a more targeted approach. I'm strictly focused on applying for more frontend focused roles since I don't like dealing with cloud services and setup all that much. It's not like I'll actually get any interviews with my current application so might as well apply to things I'll enjoy.

Doing something mobile related also seems interesting, but I don't have any app ideas at the moment.

The huge amounts of snowfall has finally ended after this afternoon. I think the news said that over 60cm of snow fell over the past week or so. Looking through the sliding door of the kitchen and seeing the snow basically reach the bottom of it, I'm inclined to agree that 60cm has indeed fallen. There's not much more space in the front yard to pile more snow and who know how long it'll take to melt it all. 

I do wonder though if this year's summer will be be the opposite, with extreme sunlight and heat. Would be in for an interesting ride. Although by that time I be living in a condo.

I also got started writing the first few sentences of my novel inbetween sets when I went to the gym on Friday. Honestly I found myself enjoying the process, but I'm scared of writing a terrible story. So yeah, lots of planning and such needs to be done.
