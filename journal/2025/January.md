Happy new years! Wish I wasn't sick but gotta make with what you have. Had a relatively productive day today, doing everything I wanted to. Let's hope for good things to come ^.^ .

### Thursday January 2, 23:41

Didn't earn as much money as I wanted to today as I had to spend more time on other tasks. But off to a good start.

I've finally apologized to someone I care about for something stupid I did in the past so that's one item off my regret list.

### Friday January 3, 23:42

When working on a task over a long period of time, it's important to not lose sight of why you started it in the first place and what you wanted from it.

### Saturday January 4, 23:33

Not a bad day. Pushed myself a bit to get some work done.

### Sunday January 5, 23:22

Completed a coding assessment and did a bit more work.

### Monday January 6, 23:38

Today I found out 40 minutes is enough time for a meaningful workout.

### Tuesday January 7, 23:44

Sometimes I feel like there is not enough minutes in a day.

### Wednesday January 8, 23:36

Always try to keep things as simple as possible. Especially when working on projects. Don't go overboard because you never know if things are as simple as they seem.

### Thursday January 9, 23:21

Why waste your time reinventing the wheel when there's no guarantee you'll do it better? There's absolutely no shame using the work built by countless others to get your job done.

### Friday January 10, 23:44

Rest in peace stink bug that I killed.

### Saturday January 11, 23:26

Woke up to a nice layer of snowfall. Winter has some really pretty scenery.

### Sunday January 12, 23:40

Ah I did it again; spent the entire day reading.

### Tuesday January 14, 23:25

THe project dashboard for my second job has dried up the last few days. Is this a sign of bad things to come?

### Wednesday January 15, 23:52

Latest chapter of FGO released today so I've been playing for for a good chunk of the day.

### Thursday January 16, 16:19

Finished LB7 and damn, it did not disappoint at all. This might've been my favourite lostbelt.

### Friday January 17, 23:17

Rather long day of work today. Planning on getting a lot of stuff done over the next couple of days.

### Saturday January 18, 23:46

Another long day of work today, but I didn't really mind it.

### Sunday January 19, 23:30

I have a new goal, to be able to do the planche one day. I'll spend a bit of time each day working on progression exercises towards it. Obviously this isn't something that will be done quickly, but lets see how far I can get in a year.

### Monday January 20, 23:29

I've been thinking about applying to analyst jobs instead of programming since I haven't been able to get get any responses outside of people reaching out to me.

I also realize how much I hate people who self pity and do little to change their situation. There's always something out there that you can do, you just gotta find it.

### Tuesday January 21, 23:42

After finishing the latest season of Bleach today, I realize how much more I enjoy good, well placed plot over sakuga animation.

### Wednesday January 22, 23:48

I feel like things are slowly clicking into place.

### Thursday January 23, 23:42

Dry eyes are such a pain.

### Saturday January 25, 23:26

Attempted to read raw Chinese WN, but it's impossible at my current level. I have to use a translator for every other phrase in a sentence.

Although I did come across something interesting. There's a new AI model in town called DeepSeek and it was trained with English and Chinese text. In other words its perfect for acting as a translating tool! I expect it to be good with coding too.
