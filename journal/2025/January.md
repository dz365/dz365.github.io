Happy new years! Wish I wasn't sick but gotta make with what you have. Had a relatively productive day today, doing everything I wanted to. Let's hope for good things to come ^.^ .

Didn't earn as much money as I wanted to today as I had to spend more time on other tasks. But off to a good start.

I've finally apologized to someone I care about for something stupid I did in the past so that's one item off my regret list.

When working on a task over a long period of time, it's important to not lose sight of why you started it in the first place and what you wanted from it.
