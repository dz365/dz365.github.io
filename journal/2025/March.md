I think I just got kicked out of my AI training partime today. The sudden drop in money came at one of the worst possible times, but I have a little under 2 months to prepare, and get things back on track. I'll be moving next month on the 23rd. This do-or-die scenario is a bit exciting and may be the motivation I've been looking for all this time.
